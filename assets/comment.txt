 I was up at the mall walking around with my son while he looked at shoes and decided to stop into Star Coffee to grab an iced latte while walking around. I got the pumpkin spice latte and I must say it was excellent! Service was also very friendly. I will definitely be back in there on my next trip to the mall.
